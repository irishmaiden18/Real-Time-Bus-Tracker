# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
## Exercise on viewing bus stops between Harvard & MIT
<p>In this exercise, I created a real-time map with a marker at the MIT campus. I created a button that, when pressed, moves the marker from one bus stop to the next until the marker reaches the Harvard campus. Each bus stop is at the coordinates of a real bus stop on the bus-line.</p>
